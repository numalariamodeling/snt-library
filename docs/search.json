This includes aspects like the population size, birth rates, non-malaria mortality rates, age structure, initial prevalence, and more. Full documentation on the demographics file can be found here.\nAt least one demographics file is required for every simulation unless you set the parameter Enable_Demographics_Builtin to 1 (one) in the configuration file. This setting does not represent a real location and is generally only used for testing and validating code.\nFor many applications, users often will reuse a standard demographics file and make modifications by hand or by script. In more complex simulations, creating a demographics file from scratch may be needed.\n\n\nA demographics file is a JSON file organized into 4 main sections:\n\nMetadata\nNodeProperties\nDefaults\n\nParameters applied to all nodes in the simulation\n\nNodes: each node is a simulated location.
